# Summary

Scraperr is a self-hosted web application that allows users to scrape data from web pages by specifying elements via XPath. Users can submit URLs and the corresponding elements to be scraped, and the results will be displayed in a table.

From the table, users can download an excel sheet of the job's results, along with an option to rerun the job.

## Troubleshooting

Q: When running Scraperr, I'm met with "404 Page not found".  
A: This is probably an issue with MongoDB related to running Scraperr in a VM. You should see something liks this in `make logs`:

```
WARNING: MongoDB 5.0+ requires a CPU with AVX support, and your current system does not appear to have that!
```

To resolve this issue, simply set CPU host type to `host`. This can be done in Proxmox in the VM settings > Processor. [Related issue](https://github.com/jaypyles/Scraperr/issues/9).
